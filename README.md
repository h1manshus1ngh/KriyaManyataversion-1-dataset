We present the first version of our novel dataset, Kriya Manyata V1, designed explicitly for action recognition research purposes. The KM v1 dataset encompasses diverse video data sources, including footage captured by CCTV cameras and recordings from handheld devices. This dataset aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive collection encompassing various environmental conditions. Figure 2 provides the distribution of the KM v1 dataset. The proposed dataset contains a total of 3,380 videos comprising 20 distinct activity classes that can be grouped into four major categories: humans with objects, human body new video dataset has challenges like variability in lighting conditions, encompassing scenarios such as sunlight, regular daylight, and low light conditions, captured through diverse sources including CCTV cameras, handheld recording devices using different frame rates, and visually similar but distinct actions to make a diverse dataset which can boost learning of deep learning models in the field of action recognition. Because the data is around 39.3 GB, we cannot upload it here. The dataset will be available at request.
